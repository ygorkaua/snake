# Snake Game! :snake:

Hi! Here is my first Python repository.



## About the project

In this project, I used the Pygame library to develop the classic snake game in Python.



## Looking at the code

I defined 600x600 pixels to the Window size, and 20x20 pixels to the snake size (the first size, adding more 20px after eating a food.)

When the snake eats a food, the snake size increases and the food appear in other place of the window.

When the snake hits the window "wall" or their own body, the window close (game over).

I defined 5 frames per second to the initial speed of the snake, but when the snake eats a food, the speed increases in one, making the game more difficult.



## Thanks

Thanks to the Kenzie Academy Brasil team, especially to Guilherme Gervasio who lead the classes :)
